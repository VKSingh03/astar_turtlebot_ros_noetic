<!-- ## Source Code Files

- [`phase2map1.py`](phase2map1.py) - Contains the implementation of Astar algorithm to solve the path planning problem.
  + The program will run a A* algorithm for path planning and create a video. This video will be saved after execution as Astar01.avi.
  + Once the program runs  completetly it will show  a image output of optimum path.
  + Press enter once the image is shown this will complete the video recording
  + The program will ask the user to give the inputs for start and goal and check wheter it is valid.
  + Selecting Robot Clearance values and Object Clearance values above 5 will make the right most area on the map inaccessible. 

- [`Astar_turtlebot.py`](Astar-turtlebot.py) - Contains the implementation of Astar algorithm to solve the path planning problem.
  + The program will run a A* algorithm for path planning and create a video of the entire node generation. This video will be saved after execution as Astar02.avi.
  + Once the program runs  completetly it will show  a image output of optimum path.
  + Press enter once the image is shown this will complete the video recording
  + The program will ask the user to give the inputs for start and goal and check wheter it is valid.


Note: The output videos in both cases is created as .avi which is converted to .mp4 using another software. -->

  <!-- To test any other initial state and goal state, provide the states to --InitState and --GoalState parameter while running the code (x y theta). 

  The canvas size is 600\*200 for the map in Astar_turtlebot.py
  The canvas size is 600\*250 for the map in phase2map1.py
  The inputs of initial and goal nodes should be given in Cartetsian Coordinates, and Step size between 1 to 10.  -->

## How to Run the Program:

To run the program, clone the package in catkin workspace and then follow the below steps:
